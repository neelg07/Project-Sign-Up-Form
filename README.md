# Project-Sign-Up-Form

- The first project in Intermediate HTML and CSS Section of The Odin Project.
- I will be using much of the new HTML & CSS techniques/skills learned to recreate a sign-up form based on a template with personal-chosen changes made to it. 
- This is to mainly reinforce my knowledge on forms, i.e. form basics and form validation, and decorating using css.
